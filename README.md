# Student-Activity-Monitoring-Ai

# Realtime Student Activity Monitoring with AI – Powered in Computer Labs

🚀 A smart and AI-enhanced Python system for monitoring student activity in computer labs. It tracks keystrokes, application usage, and unauthorized software behavior in real-time. The system automatically generates reports and sends alerts via email to educators, helping maintain a productive and focused digital learning environment.

---

## 📌 Project Description

This project uses Python-based automation and machine learning to monitor and analyze students' digital activity on lab systems. It focuses on:
- Capturing keystrokes
- Logging and visualizing application usage
- Detecting and reporting unauthorized activities
- Predicting the next likely application to be used using a machine learning model
- Sending email alerts with logs and visual reports to the class teacher

> 🧠 Ideal for maintaining discipline, preventing digital distractions, and ensuring responsible use of lab systems.

## 🎯 Key Features

✅ Keystroke logging  
✅ Application usage tracking and visualization  
✅ Blocking/unblocking distracting websites  
✅ RandomForest-based app usage prediction  
✅ Automated email alerts with logs and reports  
✅ Detailed documentation & presentation attached

---

## 🧠 AI Module

A `RandomForestClassifier` model is trained on synthetic application usage data:
- Features: Hour of the day and last used application index
- Target: Next likely application to be used
- Used for intelligent predictions and behavior pattern analysis

## 🧠 Machine Learning - App Prediction

- Uses a simulated dataset to predict which app the student might use next.
- Helps identify productivity trends and patterns.
- Built using `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`.

---

## 📤 Email Alerts

The system emails the class teacher:
- Application log (`application_log.txt`)
- Keystroke log (`keystroke_log.txt`)
- Usage graph (`app_usage_report.png`)
- Predicted next app & most used app

Make sure to configure your **Gmail App Password** in `usage.py` securely.

---

## 🖥️ Screenshots & Reports

Reports are saved as:
- `app_usage_report.png`: Graphical visualization
- HTML email with structured report
